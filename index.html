            <h2>Let's play a game.</h2>
               <p>
                   Remember Me is a game to train your brain. <br>
                   The computer generates a pattern, you as a player <br>
                   need to replicate this pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
                After you see the computer pattern you can use your mouse<br> 
                to click the blinking buttons, or you can use the arrow keys. <br>
                You can click start in the middle to start the game.
            </p>
            <p>
                Make sure you follow the instructions in the middle.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to stop the music click the speaker icon at the bottom.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now let's start playing by clicking the button below. <br>
                Have fun!
